## Vulnerabilities Scanned

| Vulnerability rate |    Vulnerability scanned           |  Description  |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|---------------|
|     Medium         | SMB Signing not required           |Signing is not required on the remote SMB server. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks against the SMB server.|
|     Medium         | SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted  |The server's X.509 certificate cannot be trusted.If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.|
|      Low           | DCE Services Enumeration           |By sending a Lookup request to the portmapper (TCP 135 or epmapper PIPE) it was possible to enumerate the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) services running on the remote port. |
|      Low           | Netstat Portscanner (SSH)          |Nessus was able to run 'netstat' on the remote host to enumerate the open ports. If 'netstat' is not available, the plugin will attempt to use 'ss'.|
